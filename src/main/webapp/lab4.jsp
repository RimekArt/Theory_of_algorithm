                +"date of products before one consumes them improves safety and "
                +"quality of life. Also, you will never run out of anything when"
                +"you need it at the last moment."
                +"3. Time: The amount of time saved in monitoring and the number:"
                +"of trips done otherwise would be tremendous."
                +"4. Money: The financial aspect is the best advantage. This "
                +"technology could replace humans who are in charge of "
                +"monitoring and maintaining supplies.");%></p>
